                                            <h4>Murud<span>Beach</span></h4>
                                            <p>
                                            Murud is a village in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, India. It is 420.92 hectares in size.
                                                Durga Devi Mandir's pillars and roof are carved out of wood with intricate figures and is delightfully painted in pastel shades. All pillars are different from each other. A huge metal bell, supposedly brought from the Vasai fort by Chimaji Appa is also on display.

Murud beach is made of very soft sand and is safe for swimming. Activities like parasailing, dune buggy rides, camel rides, horse-cart rides and water scooters are available. Dolphin watching boats leave early in the morning to take tourists out into the sea to watch dolphins.

A museum housing rare photographs and articles used by Maharshi Karve is maintained by Vaze family.[3] Keshavraj Mandir[4] in nearby Asud and Kadyavarcha Ganpati[5] in nearby Anjarle are both worth a visit.

                                            <p>Raja Ram Rao Patil was Koli Patil of Janjira Island who established and/or built this island in the 16th century for kolis to live peacefully away from pirates. After gaining permission from the Sultan of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, he built the island but later refused to obey the orders of the Sultan. So the Sultan sent his Admiral Piram Khan to capture the janjira. Due to the castle's fortifications, Piram Khan was unable to attack the island conventionally, so he disguised himself as a merchant and requested to stay a night at janjira and permission was granted. Piram Khan hosted a party under the guise of thanking the patil. When the Patil and kolis were intoxicated, Piram Khan attacked them with his men who had been hidden in barrels and captured the island.</p>
